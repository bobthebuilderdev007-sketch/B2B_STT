This item is not completed Next one find a solution for entity self auto triggering issue. I have produced a solution for the customer and we also are in discussion I I explained how we can resolve it and they took a time out to discuss it internally. I wait for the decision support on request and pin a get ticket I have completed this ticket for for Royston and also I I worked on the FPM SAP integration for Fabi because we\u0027ve migrated from one solution to another one and it takes much time to resolve all the issues of the bugs I bring during the immigration but hopefully we resolved it because before Fabi has his revocation I\u0027m the best this week.

    "Text": "Thank you. So my tasks from Casino so the starting with the production testing Was postponed for next week because of some pending tasks in the test environment. However, we did the remaining tests for the forms on the test environment and also some bounce bounce data flows. So I think so from the next week we will be dedicating the next two weeks for the prod Regarding Lisp mobility. These tasks are done. I also have finished two new tasks that were given ad hoc and yeah, there\u0027s mainly nothing much this week in terms of new sprints. So that probably will come up next week. Finn, continue with customer voice use case that is completed thanks to Sergey. Also successfully tested with client on Thursday. Have some improvements, but nothing regarding development for you Sergey. It\u0027s just customizations for my set. Yeah, PL200 Prep 4 is not done. Seriously need to really block that and take that, you know, start doing that from next week. Addition to that I had some tasks for handing over tasks for gats. Oh, I think so. We have. I\u0027ve completed all the handovers. Also had some technical meetings yesterday for the new with the new project team there and yeah, mainly that was it. I\u0027m the best this week. I\u0027m happy that I had good progress with the Pinagi customer voice issues. I have learned much more from what I\u0027ve understood and you know, got to do a lot of workarounds which are working. Thankfully. The other reason is this week was not that easy mentally for me, as some of you would have known that. Yeah, I had my grandmother passed away this Tuesday, so coming back to work was a little difficult. But I kept telling myself that life goes on, we have to to the things that we have to do. So yeah, that way I consider it was. Yeah, I was positive enough to come back the next day and start with my tasks. That\u0027s all. Thank you. Fabian. Fabian is on leave. Sergey, if you don\u0027t know, he\u0027s fighting. So for around 10 days leave. He\u0027ll come 23rd of this month back to office.",
